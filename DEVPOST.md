## Inspiration

The idea for Habit Pilot came from our personal struggles with creating and sticking to daily routines. We wanted to create a tool that would make it easy for people to track their habits and see progress over time.

## What it does

Habit Pilot is an open-source habit tracking tool that allows users to set goals, track progress, and receive reminders for daily habits. It also includes a visualization of progress like Github's contribution graph.


## How we built it

Following are the technologies used to build Habit Pilot:

- Next.js
- tRPC
- Courier (for email notifications)
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase
- Tailwind CSS

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we faced was creating a user-friendly interface that would be easy for people of all skill levels to use. Additionally, we had to work on making sure the reminders and notifications were delivered at the correct times.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the overall design of Habit Pilot and the way it helps users stay on track with their daily habits.  We are also proud of the fact that we were able to create a fully functional product in such a short amount of time.

## What we learned

Through building Habit Pilot, we learned the importance of user-centered design and how important it is to consider the user experience when building a tool like this. We also learned how to use Next.js, tRPC, Courier and Tailwind CSS 

## What's next for Habit Pilot

In the future, we would like to add more features to Habit Pilot such as a mobile app, a social aspect, and a way to track habits over a longer period of time. We would also like to add more customization options for users to make Habit Pilot more personalized.
